# Animal-Breed-List

The Animal Breed List corresponds to the Breed Assessed item in the Animal Data Standard, which defines two data fields to describe Breed:

1. Breed Assessed represents a visual assessment of an animal's primary or major breed; and
2. Breed Distribution is a two-dimensional matrix of breed identifiers and the proportion of each breed in the animal.

Some Breed names will be suitable for use in a visual assessment of breed, but would not be suitable for use in describing Breed Distribution, and vice versa. For cattle, the formal codes are defined by the ICAR 2 character and 3 character codes where they exist, and informal codes by the prefix column. Where there is an *symbol next to the prefix for the Cattle breed, this indicates an "informal" prefix, where an ICAR 2 character or 3 character code is already listed.

Data for the Animal Breed list uses the following sources: ICAR Interbull Breed Codes, FAO DAD-IS, SIL, FarmIQ, pureFarming, and Oklahoma State University. Links to these sources can be found in the Referenced Documents section of the Animal Data Standard.

The latest animal breed version will be published on this site.
